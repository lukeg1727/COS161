Never go home alone
Go for it on fourth down 
Sometimes you're the bug; sometimes you're the windshield
Never go to bed angry
There are few woes that some time spent in nature can't cure
A good nature can solve many conflicts
A friend in need is a friend indeed
Take second chances at your first opportunity
Discretion is the better course
Never attribute to malice that which can be explained by incompetence
